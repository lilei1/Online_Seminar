CTAG/PEQG online conference is a terrific meeting. I attended two years ago in U of Winsconsin Madson and really enjoyed the talks and social with other attendees. Unfortunately this year eveything is going online and can not do the acutal social with friends and collegues. But the good thing is that GSA did recording all of the talks and allow us to login to watch the vedio within 3o days. This is terrific!

Here I listed all of the intersting talks I thought and add a little bit comments:
